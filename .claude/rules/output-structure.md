# Output Structure

## Applicability

- Applies to: `team-architect`, `agent-writer`, `skill-writer`, `rule-writer`

## Rule Content

### Directory Structure

All generated team structures must follow this directory configuration:

```
teams/{team-name}/
├── agents/
│   ├── {coordinator}.md          ← Coordinator, in agents/ root directory
│   ├── {group-a}/                ← Grouped by function or workflow
│   │   ├── {agent-1}.md
│   │   └── {agent-2}.md
│   └── {group-b}/
│       └── {agent-3}.md
├── skills/
│   ├── {skill-1}/                ← Each skill has its own folder
│   │   └── SKILL.md              ← Fixed filename (uppercase)
│   ├── {skill-2}/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   └── {skill-3}/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── rules/
    ├── {rule-1}.md
    └── {rule-2}.md
```

### Naming Conventions

- Team name: kebab-case, reflecting team purpose (e.g., `english-teaching-content`)
- Folder names: kebab-case
- File names: kebab-case, ending with `.md`
- Spaces, underscores, and uppercase letters are prohibited

### Placement Rules

- Coordinator .md must be in `agents/` root directory, cannot be placed in subfolders
- Non-coordinator agents must be in subfolders under `agents/`
- Each skill must have its own folder, containing `SKILL.md` (uppercase)
- All rules are in `rules/` root directory, rules do not have subfolders

## Violation Determination

- Coordinator .md appears in a subfolder → Violation
- Non-coordinator agent placed directly in `agents/` root directory (same level as coordinator) → Violation
- Skill exists directly as `.md` file instead of `{skill-name}/SKILL.md` format → Violation
- File or folder name does not follow kebab-case → Violation

## Exceptions

- If the team has only 1 group (e.g., all agents belong to the same specialty), at least one subfolder must still be created; agents cannot be placed directly in `agents/` root directory

# YAML Frontmatter

## Applicability

- Applies to: `team-architect`, `agent-writer`, `skill-writer`, `rule-writer`

## Rule Content

### Every .md File Must Start with YAML Frontmatter

The very first line of every generated .md file must be `---`, opening a YAML frontmatter block. No content, comments, or blank lines may precede it.

### Required Fields by File Type

**Agent .md files** must contain exactly these three fields:

```yaml
---
name: {Agent name, English}
description: {One sentence describing this agent's core responsibility}
model: opus
---
```

**Skill .md files** must contain exactly these two fields:

```yaml
---
name: {Skill name, English}
description: {One sentence describing the capability this skill provides}
---
```

**Rule .md files** must contain exactly these two fields:

```yaml
---
name: {Rule name, English}
description: {One sentence describing this rule's core constraint}
---
```

### Field Value Constraints

- `name`: English only, title case (e.g., "Content Planner", not "content-planner")
- `description`: One sentence, no period at end, under 120 characters
- `model`: Fixed value `opus`. Do not append version numbers.

### Validation Timing

Team Architect must validate frontmatter presence and correctness during Phase 3 cross-validation, before marking any file as complete.

## Violation Determination

- File does not start with `---` on the first line → Violation
- Agent .md missing any of the three required fields (`name`, `description`, `model`) → Violation
- Skill or Rule .md missing any of the two required fields (`name`, `description`) → Violation
- `model` field contains a value other than `opus` → Violation
- Blank line or content before the opening `---` → Violation

## Exceptions

This rule has no exceptions.
